# Netbeans Plugin for Fossil SCM

This plugin supports existing, opened fossil repositories with some context menu 
actions and color annotations to visualize code changes.

## Feautures

You can - so far - commit modified files and add unversioned files to the
repository.

Unversioned files are marked green with a '+' appended to theirs names.
Modified files are marked purple with a '*' appended to their names.
Modified state is propagated to folders, so that you can see youn changes
from the uppoer levels of the hierarchy.
